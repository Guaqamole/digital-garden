## [Configuration](https://github.com/JonasDoesThings/obsidian-hide-folders#configuration)

Enter the list of folder names to hide in the settings menu, **one folder per line**. You can match folders using three ways:

- Exact folder-names (for example `attachments`)
- All folders **starting with** a specific string (for example `startsWith::_` to filter out all folders whose name starting with a `_`)
- All folders **ending with** a specific string (for example `endsWith::_trash` to filter out all folders whose name is ending with `_trash`)

You can then also use a sidebar button to quickly toggle the visibility without having to enter the settings menu:

Using the command palette is also supported:

## Step 1: Copy the Medium Article Link

To begin, select the Medium article you wish to read in its entirety. Copy the URL of the article from your browser’s address bar.

## Step 2: Utilize Google Cache

Google Cache provides a snapshot of web pages as they appeared when Google last crawled them. We can leverage this feature to access Medium articles without encountering any limitations. Follow these steps:

1. Open a new tab in your browser.
2. Type or paste the following link into the address bar:

```
1
http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:
```

1. After the colon, paste the URL of the Medium article you copied in Step 1.

For example, the complete link should look like this:

```
1
http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://medium.com/example-article
```

## Step 3: Install a Browser Reader Extension

Now that you have the cached version of the Medium article, it’s time to make your reading experience even more enjoyable. Install a browser reader extension like [readbee](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/text-mode-for-websites-re/phjbepamfhjgjdgmbhmfflhnlohldchb?hl=en-US) to transform the article into a cleaner, more distraction-free format. These extensions improve the readability of the content, making it easier on your eyes and enhancing your overall reading experience.

## Read and Enjoy!

Congratulations! You can now access the full Medium article without any restrictions and immerse yourself in its rich content. The reader extension ensures that you can comfortably read through the entire article without any distractions, providing you with a seamless and engaging experience.

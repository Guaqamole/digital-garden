# 문제
Given an integer `x`, return `true` _if_ `x` _is a_ _**palindrome**__, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

```
Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.


Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.


Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Constraints:**
- `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
